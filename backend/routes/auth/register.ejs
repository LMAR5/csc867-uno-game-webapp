      <p class="mt-2 text-base text-gray-500 pb-12">
        Players start each round by dealing 5 cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed facedown,
        and the top card of this stack is turned over next to it to start the game.

        A player can play a card on the discard pile that matches the top card of the pile in either color or symbol
        (number or special card marker), or a wild card. Starting with the person to the dealer's left, players
        take turns in a clockwise direction placing one or more cards on the discard pile. If a player cannot
        play or chooses not to play even if they have a playable card, they must draw a card from the deck.
        If the drawn card can be played, it can be played immediately before the next person's turn
        (or it can be kept if the player chooses not to). The first person to get rid of all their cards wins the game.
